     <h3 > The Visionary Who Changed the World :<br><br>
        In 1976, two young men, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, built the first Apple computer in a garage.<br> <br>They had a vision to make personal computing accessible to everyone, and Apple was born. Jobs, with his keen eye for design and innovation, played a crucial <br><br>role in shaping the company‚Äôs future.<br><br>
        
        Apple's first major success came with the Apple II, a revolutionary personal computer that was one of the first to be sold to the public. But it was 1984 that<br><br> marked a turning point. Jobs introduced the Macintosh, a computer with a graphical user interface (GUI) that made personal computers user-friendly. <br><br>The ‚Äú1984‚Äù commercial, aired during the Super Bowl, famously showcased Apple's rebellion against the big, faceless corporate world represented by IBM. </h3>
