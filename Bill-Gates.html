     <h3>!! In the early days of Microsoft, Bill Gates and his team were working hard to develop a new operating system‚ÄîMS-DOS‚Äîfor IBM's first personal computer. <br> <br>In 1980, IBM reached out to Microsoft to provide an operating system for their new PC. The challenge was that Microsoft didn‚Äôt have an operating system ready, <br><br>but Gates was determined to seize the opportunity.<br><br>

        Instead of developing an OS from scratch, Gates made a deal to buy an existing system (QDOS), which he modified and rebranded as MS-DOS. <br><br>This move was a game-changer.
        
        When the deal was finalized, IBM assumed they were licensing MS-DOS exclusively, but Gates had kept the rights to license it <br><br>to other computer manufacturers. This was a brilliant move‚ÄîMicrosoft ended up licensing MS-DOS to multiple companies, making it the standard operating system for PCs worldwide.<br><br>
        
        By 1986, when Microsoft went public, Gates became a billionaire at just 31 years old.<br><br> This story shows how his bold thinking and calculated risk-taking helped him build the foundation for his success, which would later allow him to focus on global philanthropy.</h3>
